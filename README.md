# Cleanup

_keep your community clean!_<br>

'Cleanup' is a lightweight react-native app for a community to take actions and clean up trash in their neighborhood.  You can check your area to see if any locations need to be cleaned.  You can also take a picture or pick an image from your gallery and leave a marker with details.
